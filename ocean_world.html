                                Climate change is the greatest global threat to coral reef ecosystem. Evidence suggests that
                                increases in temperature and changes in the atmosphere are <i>directly</i> linked to greenhouse gases, which
                                have been on the rise due to human activities.
                                <br><br>
                                So how does this effect coral reefs? 
                                <br>
                                The answer lies in the temperature.
                                <br><br>
                                As global temperatures rise, sea temperatures also naturally rises. This becomes the perfect condition
                                for infectious diseases to breed and allows for a process known as coral bleaching to take place.
                                <br><br>
                                To better understand coral bleaching, we must first understand how a coral survives.
                                <br><br>
                                A coral has a symbiotic (both sides benefit) relationship with algae (known as <i>zooxanthellae</i>). This species
                                of algae supply the coral with food and give the coral color.
                                <br>
                                If the coral becomes stressed due to increases in temperature, this algae leaves the coral; essentially leaving the
                                coral vulnerable to infection and attacks. If nothing is done, the coral will eventually die.
                                <br><br>
                                Corals are an essential part of, not only the ocean, but to humanity and the Earth as a whole. Without corals coastlines
                                will erode, storms will appear much stronger, people will lose jobs, and over half a billion people will be without food.

                               Blue whales are the largest animals of all time on the planet and can weigh up to 400,000 pounds and reaching lengths of 98 feet.
                               <br><br>
                               Despite the blue whale's immense size, it is not immune to climate change.
                               <br><br>
                               In the past, the threat to blue whales has been commercial whaling, but today, climate change may prove to be an
                               indirect threat to blue whales.
                               <br><br>
                               Climate causes the melting of polar ice (glaciers, large ice structures, etc.) which is already poses a big threat to land animals, but
                               to blue whales living in the ocean, how could this be an issue?
                               <br><br>
                               The melting of polar ice causes the whale's main food source, krill, to lose its main prey. Krill depends on algae plankton
                               trapped in the polar ice for nourishment, with the polar ice melting, this reduces the habitat that this algae plankton can reproduce
                               and, in turn, all those that rely on this algae will also feel the repercussions.
                               <br><br>
                               This is essentially known as the "domino-effect"—when the bottom of the food chain is disrupted, the rest of the food chain is also effected.
                               <br><br>
                               The blue whale is currently endangered and has quite a long gestation period of 10-12 months (time required to give birth).
                               This means that any type of type of population decrease in the current blue whale population will be incredibly detrimental to
                               the food chain.

                            <p>
                               There is a total of seven sea lion species:
                               <ul>
                                   <li>Galápagos sea lion</li>
                                   <li>California sea lion</li>
                                   <li>Australian sea lion</li>
                                   <li>Steller's sea lion</li>
                                   <li>New Zealand sea lion</li>
                                   <li>Southern American sea lion</li>
                                   <li>Japanese sea lion</li>
                               </ul>

                               Of these species of sea lion, the California and South American sea lion are not endangered.
                               <br><br>
                               The Steller, Australian, Galápagos, and New Zealand sea lions are endangered.
                               <br><br>
                               And finally, the Japanese sea lion is extinct.
                               <br><br>
                               The Japanese sea lion is an outlier of sorts since it went extinct in the 1970s. However, this species did not 
                               go extinct on a whim. The Japanese sea lion had no natural predators, but humans hunted it to extinction for
                               fur, oil, and medicine. It is said that in the 1930s, not even fifty of these seals were alive.
                               <br><br>
                               Most of the other species that are endangered also suffer this same fate. Many were overhunted and almost wiped out.
                               <br><br>
                               Climate change does affect these sea lions. The Calfornia sea lion is a prime example of this.
                               <br><br>
                               With the warming of the ocean, algae blooms are becoming more frequent, which is resulting in the main prey of these
                               seals, fish and other sea animals, to migrate colder water.
                               <br><br>
                               But why does an algae bloom cause this?
                               <br><br>
                               An algae bloom is an explosion in algae that grows above the water, this blocks out the sun to many of the organisms living in 
                               the water below. The algae will also consume an immense amount of oxygen from the water thereby essentially suffocating the 
                               organisms that live below. This is why fish migrate.
                               <br><br>
                               The migration of these fishes causes the sea lion to swim further in search of food for its young which can cause starvation if the
                               journey is too long.
                               <br><br>
                               Sea lions are also a critical part of the ecosystem and help keep the population of other sea animals in check.

                               Sea turtles are one of the oldest animals on planet Earth. It is said that sea turtles have remained essentially unchanged
                               for 110 million years!
                               <br><br> 
                               That being said, sea turtles do not live easy lives. Studies have shown that out of 1,000 sea turtle eggs laid, only one
                               reaches adulthood due to being hunted by natural predators and humans alike.
                               <br><br>
                               If that wasn't enough, now we have climate change posing yet another big threat on the livelihood of sea turtles.
                               <br><br>
                               Climate change causes sea levels to rise, which by itself might not seem like a bad thing for sea turtles, but the sea level rising
                               destroys the turtle's beach habitats where these turtles eventually lay eggs of the next generation.
                               <br><br>
                               Because sea turtles have many predators, the warming of the seas may change the currents resulting in the introduction of new predators
                               that will hunt the turtle.
                               <br><br>
                               An interesting thing of note is that the temperature of the sand where the eggs of sea turtles incubate determine the gender.
                               <br><br>
                               Warmer sand typically indicates female offspring while colder sand typically indicates male offspring.
                               <br><br>
                               This implies that sea turtles may go extinct due to a shortage of males.
